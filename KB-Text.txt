Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Understanding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) at Alltech IT Solutions 

At Alltech IT Solutions, our Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are designed to ensure that your IT needs are met with the highest standards of service and efficiency. An SLA defines the level of service you can expect from us and sets clear expectations regarding response and resolution times for any issues or requests you submit. 

 

Our SLAs are crafted to align with the criticality of your business needs, ensuring that urgent matters are addressed promptly, and routine issues are resolved efficiently. 

 

What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)? 

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal commitment between you and Alltech IT Solutions that outlines the level of service we will provide. It defines: 

 

Response Times: The time it takes for our team to acknowledge and begin working on your request. 

Resolution Times: The time within which we aim to resolve your issue or complete your request, based on its urgency and complexity. 

Priority Levels: Issues are categorized by priority (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) to ensure the most urgent matters are addressed first. 

How SLAs Work in Our Support System 

When you submit a ticket via the Client Portal, email, or phone, our system automatically assigns a priority level based on the nature of the issue. The priority level determines the SLA for that specific ticket. Here’s how it works: 

 

Ticket Submission: Once you submit a ticket, the issue is categorized by its priority level. Factors such as the impact on your business operations, the number of users affected, and the type of issue (e.g., security incident, hardware failure, general request) help determine this priority. 

 

Response Time: The response time SLA specifies how quickly we will begin addressing your ticket. For example, a critical issue affecting your entire network will receive immediate attention, while lower-priority requests may have a longer response time. 

 

Resolution Time: The resolution time SLA sets expectations for how long it will take to resolve the issue. Critical issues are typically resolved as quickly as possible, often within a few hours, while less urgent issues may have a longer window for resolution. 

 

SLA Priority Levels 

We categorize tickets into different priority levels, each with its own SLA for response and resolution times. Here’s an example breakdown: 

 

Priority 1 (Critical): Severe issue impacting your entire business or a large group of users. Example: Network outage, system-wide failure. 

 

Response Time: 15 minutes 

Resolution Time: 4 hours

Google Workspace: Provides cloud-based alternatives like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. While these apps are collaborative and simple to use, they may lack some of the advanced features found in Microsoft’s desktop apps. However, they are ideal for real-time collaboration in a browser environment. 

Comparison: Microsoft provides more advanced, feature-rich desktop applications, while Google Workspace focuses on lightweight, cloud-based solutions optimized for collaboration. 

2. Email & Calendar 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Includes Exchange Online, which powers Outlook, a widely used email and calendar solution. Outlook offers powerful organization tools, integrates deeply with Office apps, and supports advanced filtering, categorization, and delegation. 

Google Workspace: Includes Gmail and Google Calendar, offering a familiar and user-friendly interface with strong integration into the Google ecosystem. Gmail’s search capabilities are widely regarded as some of the best, and Google Calendar’s simplicity makes scheduling easy. 

Comparison: Gmail offers simplicity and ease of use with unmatched search capabilities, while Outlook provides more advanced features for email and calendar management, particularly in business environments. 

3. Collaboration and Communication 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Uses Microsoft Teams for collaboration, chat, video conferencing, and file sharing. Teams integrates deeply with Office apps, allowing users to co-edit documents in real-time directly from the platform, while also offering robust meeting and video calling features. 

Google Workspace: Uses Google Meet for video conferencing and Google Chat for messaging. These services are lightweight and highly integrated with Google Drive and other Google apps, but may not be as feature-rich as Teams in terms of collaboration and project management. 

Comparison: Teams provides a more comprehensive and integrated solution for businesses looking to consolidate chat, video conferencing, and file collaboration, while Google Workspace offers simpler, cloud-based tools that are easy to use but may lack some advanced functionality. 

4. Cloud Storage 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Provides each user with 1 TB of OneDrive storage, with options to integrate with SharePoint for team collaboration. OneDrive syncs files locally, providing offline access to important documents and offering seamless integration with Office apps. 

Google Workspace: Offers 30 GB to Unlimited storage per user, depending on the plan. Files are stored in Google Drive, which also integrates with Google’s productivity apps. However, the 30 GB plan may not be enough for larger businesses without upgrading. 

Comparison: Microsoft provides more robust offline functionality and large-scale storage options for individual users, while Google Workspace offers more flexible cloud storage but may require higher-tier plans for businesses needing large storage capacities. 

5. Security and Compliance 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Offers comprehensive security features, including Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Encryption, and Microsoft Intune for mobile device management. It also integrates with Azure Active Directory for identity and access management, making it ideal for businesses with complex security needs. 

Google Workspace: Offers security features like Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Safe Browsing, and built-in encryption. Google Admin provides basic Mobile Device Management (MDM) and more advanced security policies depending on the tier. 

Comparison: Microsoft 365 Business Premium is more robust in terms of enterprise-level security and device management, particularly with its integration into the broader Microsoft ecosystem, while Google Workspace provides strong but less complex security features that are more suitable for smaller businesses or those with less rigorous security demands. 

6. Mobile Device Management (MDM) 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Includes Microsoft Intune, a powerful MDM solution that allows businesses to manage devices and enforce security policies across Windows, iOS, and Android devices. 

Google Workspace: Provides basic MDM through Google Admin, allowing businesses to enforce simple security policies and manage mobile devices. For advanced features, higher-tier plans are required. 

Comparison: Microsoft Intune offers more comprehensive and flexible device management features than Google Workspace, making it a better choice for businesses that require strong MDM capabilities. 

7. Integration with Business Apps 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Offers deep integration with the Windows ecosystem, including Windows 10/11 and other Microsoft apps like SharePoint, Power BI, and Dynamics 365. It also supports a wide range of third-party apps through the Microsoft Store and Teams integrations. 

Google Workspace: Integrates seamlessly with Google apps like Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar. It also supports third-party apps via Google Workspace Marketplace, but integration with non-Google business systems may not be as deep or seamless as with Microsoft. 

Comparison: Microsoft provides more extensive integration options for businesses using a wide range of apps, particularly if they are already using other Microsoft services. Google Workspace is ideal for businesses heavily invested in Google’s ecosystem or those requiring simpler integrations. 

8. Pricing 

Microsoft 365 Business Premium: Offers a subscription-based model, with pricing typically higher than Google Workspace due to the inclusion of advanced features like desktop apps, security, and device management. 

Google Workspace: Typically has a more affordable pricing structure, especially for businesses with basic needs. However, advanced features like unlimited storage and enhanced security are only available in higher-tier plans. 

Comparison: Google Workspace is generally more cost-effective for smaller businesses with basic needs, while Microsoft 365 Business Premium offers more value for businesses requiring advanced features, security, and productivity tools. 

Which Is Right for Your Business? 

Choose Microsoft 365 Business Premium if your business needs feature-rich desktop apps, advanced security, robust device management, and seamless integration with Windows and other Microsoft products. It’s ideal for larger businesses or those with complex security and compliance requirements. 

Choose Google Workspace if your business prioritizes ease of use, affordability, real-time collaboration in a cloud environment, and deep integration with Google’s ecosystem. It’s a great choice for smaller teams or businesses that are heavily invested in cloud-based work.
